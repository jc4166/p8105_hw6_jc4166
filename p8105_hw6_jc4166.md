## Problem 1

Read in and clean birthweight data.

### Propose a regression model for birthweight.

The ouctome is birthweight (bwt).  
The potential predictors (i.e. all the variables collected) are:

Maternal Factors:  
\- mrace: mother’s race  
\- menarche: mother’s age at menarche  
\- mheight: mother’s height  
\- momage: mother’s age at delivery  
\- ppbmi: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI  
\- ppwt: mother’s pre-pregnancy weight

Pregnancy Factors:  
\- gaweeks: gestational age in weeks  
\- delwt: mother’s weight at delivery (pounds)  
\- smoken: average number of cigarettes smoked per day during
pregnancy  
\- wtgain: mother’s weight gain during pregnancy

Pregnancy History Factors:  
\- parity: number of live births prior to this pregnancy  
\- pnumlbw: previous number of low birth weight babies  
\- pnumsga: number of prior small for gestational age babies

Other Family Factors:  
\- fincome: family monthly income  
\- frace: father’s race

Baby Factors:  
\- malform: presence of malformations that could affect weight

Based on my experience as a clinician, I propose a model in which low
birthweight can be predicted by gestational age in weeks, mother’s
smoking status, history of previous low birth weight babies, income, and
presence of malformations that could affect
weight.

``` r
birthweight_model_1 = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + smoken + pnumlbw + fincome + malform, data = birthweight_data)

birthweight_model_1 %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3, caption = "Regression Summary (Model 1)")
```

| term           | estimate | p.value |
| :------------- | -------: | ------: |
| (Intercept)    |  458.699 |   0.000 |
| gaweeks        |   65.445 |   0.000 |
| smoken         |  \-6.899 |   0.000 |
| fincome        |    2.354 |   0.000 |
| malformpresent |   65.615 |   0.582 |

Regression Summary (Model 1)

``` r
birthweight_data %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(birthweight_model_1) %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(birthweight_model_1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "blue") + 
    labs(
      title = "Model Residuals vs. Fitted Values",
      x = "Fitted Values",
      y = "Residuals"
   )
```

Compare your model to two others:  
Model 2: Using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects
only)

``` r
birthweight_model_2 = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + blength, data = birthweight_data)

birthweight_model_2 %>% 
  broom::glance()  %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Regression Summary (Model 2)")
```

| r.squared | adj.r.squared |    sigma | statistic | p.value | df |     logLik |      AIC |      BIC |  deviance | df.residual |
| --------: | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ------: | -: | ---------: | -------: | -------: | --------: | ----------: |
| 0.5768894 |     0.5766943 | 333.2174 |  2958.001 |       0 |  3 | \-31381.32 | 62770.64 | 62796.14 | 481775844 |        4339 |

Regression Summary (Model 2)

Model 3: Using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between
these

``` r
birthweight_model_3 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex + bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight_data)

birthweight_model_3 %>% 
  broom::glance()  %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Regression Summary (Model 3)")
```

| r.squared | adj.r.squared |    sigma | statistic | p.value | df |    logLik |      AIC |      BIC |  deviance | df.residual |
| --------: | ------------: | -------: | --------: | ------: | -: | --------: | -------: | -------: | --------: | ----------: |
|  0.684876 |      0.684367 | 287.7344 |  1345.616 |       0 |  8 | \-30741.6 | 61501.19 | 61558.58 | 358816655 |        4334 |

Regression Summary (Model 3)

Make the comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

``` r
cv_birthweight_models =
  crossv_mc(birthweight_data, 100) %>%
    mutate( 
      train = map(train, as_tibble),
      test = map(test, as_tibble)
    )
```

``` r
cv_birthweight_models = cv_birthweight_models %>%
  mutate(
      birthweight_model_1  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + bhead + blength + smoken + fincome + pnumlbw, data = .x)),
      birthweight_model_2  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + blength, data = .x)),
      birthweight_model_3  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex + bhead * blength * babysex, data = as_tibble(.x)))
      ) %>% 
    mutate(
      rmse_birthweight_model_1 = map2_dbl(birthweight_model_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
      rmse_birthweight_model_2   = map2_dbl(birthweight_model_2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
      rmse_birthweight_model_3 = map2_dbl(birthweight_model_3, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
      )
```

``` r
cv_birthweight_models %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + 
    geom_violin(aes(fill = model, color = model)) +
    labs(
    title = "Distribution of RMSE Values (Regression Models 1, 2, 3)",
      x = "Regression Model",
      y = "RMSE")
```

Model 1 has the lowest prediction error of the three models (though
model 3 is close).

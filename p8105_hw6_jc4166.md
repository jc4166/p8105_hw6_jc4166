## Problem 1

Read in and clean birthweight data.

### Propose a regression model for birthweight.

The ouctome is birthweight (bwt).  
The potential predictors are:

Maternal Factors:  
\- mrace: mother’s race  
\- menarche: mother’s age at menarche  
\- mheight: mother’s height  
\- momage: mother’s age at delivery  
\- ppbmi: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI  
\- ppwt: mother’s pre-pregnancy weight

Pregnancy Factors:  
\- gaweeks: gestational age in weeks  
\- delwt: mother’s weight at delivery (pounds)  
\- smoken: average number of cigarettes smoked per day during
pregnancy  
\- wtgain: mother’s weight gain during pregnancy

Pregnancy History Factors:  
\- parity: number of live births prior to this pregnancy  
\- pnumlbw: previous number of low birth weight babies  
\- pnumsga: number of prior small for gestational age babies

Other Family Factors:  
\- fincome: family monthly income  
\- frace: father’s race

Baby Factors:  
\- malform: presence of malformations that could affect weight

mrace  
menarche mheight momage ppbmi ppwt gaweeks delwt smoken wtgain parity
pnumlbw pnumsga fincome frace
malform

``` r
birthweight_model_1 = lm(bwt ~ mrace + menarche + mheight + momage + ppbmi + ppwt + gaweeks + delwt + smoken + wtgain + parity + pnumlbw + pnumsga + fincome + frace + malform, data = birthweight_data)

birthweight_model_1 %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3, caption = "Regression Summary (Model 1)")
```
